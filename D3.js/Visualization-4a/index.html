          <h3 style="font-weight:bold" align:"justify" >Introduction: </h3>
          <p style="font-weight:bold" align:"justify">One of the most debatable argument is Mercedes vs BMW. This is one of the oldest rivalry in
            automobile industry. Many people argue about which is better but it is still uncertain about the real winner. For this assignment,
            I have used a dataset which contains five attributes - Price, Mileage, Tax, MPG(Miles per Gallon), Engine Size, of a Car. As a part of
            Data preprocessing, I have filtered out the data based on years and a comparable class in Excel.

          <h3 style="font-weight:bold" >Left Chart:</h3>
              <p style="font-weight:bold"> The left chart is a Spider Chart of Mercedes with each axis representing an unique attribute. The above
                mentioned dataset contains more than 100 rows and to plot a Spider Chart, I calculated mean values of a Manufacturer. Still, the
                scales of mean of different attribute are not matching. To counter this problem, I have normalized the scale of each attribute to
                values between 0 to 100. On hovering the curve area, the Spider Chart gets emphasized and the border gets highlighted.
                This chart shows that the Mercedes is a clear winner in terms of Price, Tax.

                      <p style="font-weight:bold"> The left chart is a Spider Chart of BMW with each axis representing an unique attribute. The above
                        mentioned dataset contains more than 100 rows and to plot a Spider Chart, I calculated mean values of a Manufacturer. Still, the

                              <p style="font-weight:bold"> The Rhetorics for the charts above are as follows:<br>
                                Omission: I have Omitted data of few old cars when Mercedes had not been founded.<br>
                                Contrast: Here, I have visualized the same five attributes using same kind of chart to compare between BMW and Mercedes

                                      <p style="font-weight:bold">
                                        According to me, BMW is better than Mercedes. The statistics also suggest that. BMW is superior in terms of
                                        Mileage, MPG, Engine Size. Even though Mercedes has a lower price but premium and rich consumers will always buy
                                        a luxurious cars.
