# Data-Visualization

This repository consists of few Data Visualization Projects completed by me.

The CSE 575 Data Visualization folder include two projects that I have completed using HTML,CSS and D3.js
Instructions for opening the file:
1) Clone this repository on your PC either using Git Bash or Downloading a Zip file.
2) Start a local server in your browser.
3) Open the .html file to view the visualization in your browser.
4) The visualizations are interactive and dynamic so you can try selecting different countries for the first visualization.
5) For the second visualization, you can write any text inside the text box and click on the submit button to view a donut chart. It has another dynamic feature if you hover your mouse over any arc of the donut, you can view the tooltip of the arc. You can even click on any arc to view a detailed bar chart of each character. 
4) You can also view the sample image of the visualization in the img folder inside the the visualization-1 and visualization-2.

In the Disaster Management Robot folder, I had created a live data line chart using JavaScript and Java. But the code takes live data from a sensor using Arduino Microcontroller, it is difficult to demonstrate it. Therefore, I have included a video explaining the working of the system and its visualization.

I have created a Tableau Dashboard on Analysis of Air Pollution which consists of four different charts. This chart is also interactive and you can highlight a specific marks by clicking on it.
The link to that Dashboard is given below

I have also worked with Python libraries such as Pandas and Matplotlib to create some insightful graphs. I have included a jupyter notebook, a csv file and a image of the visualization inside the Python folder. To run the notebook, you might have to open the notebok in a Google Colab.
